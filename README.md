The client is a school club that specialises in media technology that is looking to recruit students into the club, no matter the level of experience. 
They offer training to newcomers and encourage hands-on learning as they prepare their members to a possible future in media technology. 
This site is a call to join their club to all students who wish to join.
The website is adaptable to different sized devices.

Characteristics of the landing page that are different from Assignment one are:
hero section - grouped span and buttons for unity, appealed to audience with a call to action text under an image that draws the attention of the target audience.
no use of pictograms - There was no time to look for pictograms

additional sections in other pages:
a form page for signing up
an about us, gallery, and past/current projects page

currently, there has not been a deeper dive into 

AI was used for:
debugging, 
understanding, implementing, and checking for accessibility
generating a plan on how to structure the site
